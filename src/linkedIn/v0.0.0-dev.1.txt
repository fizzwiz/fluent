🚀 Exciting News: @fizzwiz/fluent Library and Blog Are Live! 🧩

I’m excited to announce the first prerelease of the @fizzwiz/fluent JavaScript library — a fresh approach to iteration and functional programming focused on clarity, composition, and expressiveness.

To support it, I’ve launched a blog that dives deep into the ideas, patterns, and design philosophy behind the project — from foundational concepts like Each and What to advanced techniques like search-and-select and early restriction.

🧠 Whether you're experimenting, building, or just exploring, I’d love your feedback!

📣 Tell me what you like, what could be better, or what you'd love to see next.

Let’s build better abstractions — together.
