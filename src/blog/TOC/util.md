# ðŸ§° The `util` Package

The `util` package provides the three structural classes of the library: `Scope`, and its two derived classes: `Path` and `Thought`.

Unlike the abstract core classes `Each` and `What`, these utility classes do not represent iterations or functions directly. Instead, they serve as contextual and structural tools that enable advanced capabilities in:

- Nesting Contexts â€” through the `Scope` class.
- Combinatorial exploration â€” through the `Path` class.

## ðŸ”§ Classes Overview

| Class     | Description                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Scope`  | Base class for contextual data storage and manipulation.                   |
| `Path`   | Extends `Scope` to represent branching sequences, useful in search spaces. |

These utility classes empower the `core` classes by carrying state, history, and contextual bindings, making them essential to the expressive power of the library.

They are designed to integrate seamlessly with the `Each` and `What` abstractions without extending them â€” enabling a clean separation between control logic and data transformation semantics.
