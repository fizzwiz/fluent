# ðŸ§­ Road Map

The journey to the first production-ready release of `@fizzwiz/fluent` begins with a few critical steps. Weâ€™re targeting version **0.0.1** as the first stable release, following a series of **pre-release milestones** under the format `0.0.0-dev.x`.

These early versions arenâ€™t just placeholders â€” theyâ€™re essential for **shaping the library in real-world contexts**. Weâ€™re using them to refine features, validate design decisions, and ensure the library performs well under actual development workloads.

## ðŸ§ª Why Use a Pre-Release?

Itâ€™s a fair question: why would any developer adopt a non-stable library?

The answer is simple:  
**Because it offers something no other library does.**

We believe that `@fizzwiz/fluent` introduces uniquely expressive patterns â€” particularly the **Search-and-Select pattern** â€” that can transform how you approach iteration and optimization problems.

## ðŸ§µðŸ§µ Parallel Development with `@fizzwiz/sorted`

To deliver this innovation early, development will progress in **parallel** with the companion library [`@fizzwiz/sorted`](https://sorted-js/blogspot.com). This tight integration is key to unlocking advanced patterns like search prioritization and lazy exploration.

Each dev release of `@fizzwiz/fluent` will be matched by a corresponding release of `@fizzwiz/sorted`. This ensures that developers can immediately use both libraries together to model powerful workflows â€” even during the early stages of the project.
