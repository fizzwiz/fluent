# ðŸ§± v0.0.0-dev.1 â€” First Brick

Weâ€™re excited to announce the very first prerelease of `@fizzwiz/fluent`: **v0.0.0-dev.1** â€” the *First Brick* in what we hope will become a foundational library for expressive, composable iteration.

This version introduces the **core abstractions**:
- `Each` â€” for lazy, fluent iteration.
- `What` â€” for powerful search space modeling.
- `Path` â€” a structural utility class essential for combinatorial workflows.

These concepts form the backbone of the library and open the door to elegant patterns like **Search-and-Select**, **early restriction**, and **composable iteration chains**.

> ðŸ§ª This is a prerelease, but it's fully functional and ready to explore. Your feedback now will help shape what comes next.

Start experimenting. Share thoughts. Letâ€™s refine it together.
